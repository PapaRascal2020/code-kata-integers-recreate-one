Codewars Kata: Find all integers between m and n (m and n integers with 1 &lt;= m &lt;= n) such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square. 

#Task

Find all integers between m and n (m and n integers with 1 <= m <= n) such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square.

We will return an array of subarrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or a string. The subarrays (or tuples or Pairs) will have two elements: first the number the squared divisors of which is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.
